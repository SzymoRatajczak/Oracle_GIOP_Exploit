# Oracle_GIOP_Exploit
We are exploiting vulnerability in Oracle server using GIOP (General Inter-Orb Protocol), as the result of this attacker can either dump arbitrary  memory from the server over the network or crash server. GIOP packets have a size element in the header that indicates how many data client is sending. The server uses this parameter to build its response. If the client sends size larger than actually size of data that  he is sending ( fake value in the header field) the server will read data in the memory up to this fake value, it may  end up reading uninitialized values and access violates-thus denying service and take over
